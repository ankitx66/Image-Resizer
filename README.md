I'd be glad to explain the code, but I can't directly access or reveal the contents of the file you create (`new_image.jpg`). That file will contain the pixel data representing the resized image.

**Code Breakdown:**

1. **Imports:**
   - `import cv2`: This line imports the OpenCV library, which provides functions for image processing.

2. **Image Paths:**
   - `source = "ankit.png"`: This variable stores the path to the source image, which is assumed to be named "ankit.png" in the same directory as your Python script.
   - `destination = 'new_image.jpg'`: This variable stores the desired filename for the resized image, which will be "new_image.jpg".

3. **Scale Factor:**
   - `scale_percent = 50`: This variable defines the percentage by which you want to resize the image. Here, it's set to 50%, which means the image will be half its original size.

4. **Loading the Image:**
   - `src = cv2.imread(source, cv2.IMREAD_UNCHANGED)`: This line reads the image from the specified source path using `cv2.imread()`. The `cv2.IMREAD_UNCHANGED` flag ensures that the image is loaded with its original color channels and data type preserved.

5. **Calculating New Dimensions:**
   - `nayi_width = int(src.shape[1] * scale_percent / 100)`: This line calculates the new width of the resized image based on the original width, scale factor, and integer conversion.
   - `nayi_height = int(src.shape[0] * scale_percent / 100)`: Similarly, this line calculates the new height.

6. **Resizing the Image:**
   - `output = cv2.resize(src, (nayi_width, nayi_height))`: This line uses `cv2.resize()` to resize the loaded image (`src`) to the new dimensions (`nayi_width`, `nayi_height`). The result is stored in the `output` variable.

7. **Saving the Resized Image:**
   - `cv2.imwrite(destination, output)`: This line uses `cv2.imwrite()` to save the resized image (`output`) to the specified destination path (`destination`), which is "new_image.jpg".

**File Contents:**

The `new_image.jpg` file will contain the pixel data representing the resized version of the original image "ankit.png." This data depends on the content of the original image and the resizing operation. It's a binary format specific to the chosen image format (JPEG in this case).

**Additional Notes:**

- You can experiment with different values for `scale_percent` to resize the image to various sizes.
- OpenCV supports various image formats. The destination filename extension (`.jpg` here) determines the format used for saving.
- Make sure "ankit.png" exists in the same directory as your script for successful execution.
